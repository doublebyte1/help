 The objective is to have a <strong>free and open-source solution</strong>, that can be used, maintained and customized in developing countries, on a zero-cost basis.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">This user guide is composed by three main chapters. The first chapter focused on main features supported by Medfisis, giving details on information supported, how information is organised and&nbsp; presented to the user, and how
 user navigates through out the interface forms to enter data</span>.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The second chapter gives insight details on the process of data storage for both data sources, artisanal fisheries and logbooks. A set of screen-shots of the application had been introduced in order to facilitate a good comprehension

<span style="font-family:Arial"></span>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId190600"><span lang="en-US"><b>NATURE OF THE INFORMATION SUPPORTED BY MedFisis 1.1<br>
</b></span></a></h2>
<span style="font-family:Arial"></span>
<p style="font-family:Arial">Medfisis consider two standard sampling processes: logbook and artisanal fisheries. Basically it offers capability to store and manage two distinct types of fisheries information, census and sampling data, typified as logbooks and
 artisanal fisheries. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial"><span style="font-weight:bold"><a name="logbooks">logbooks</a></span>: Typically the data source for semi-industrial and industrial fisheries, consisting of reports submitted by companies, vessel’s legal representative
 (master, captain, owner, etc.) giving detailed information on individual fishing operations, including fishing grounds, type and duration of operation, fishing gears, catch by species, etc..</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">Current version of Medfisis, only supports information of catches organized by commercial category, i.e., by identifying group of species (e.g Small gregarious pelagic, Large pelagic, etc.). For further details
 about <span style="font-weight:bold">Commercial Category</span> please consult the
<span style="font-weight:bold">glossary</span>. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">Even though in theory the logbooks as a data source consists of a census approach, for several circumstances sometimes logbooks are not completely collected, resulting in incomplete and inaccurate fisheries
 information. To overcome such circumstances some methodologies for <span style="font-weight:bold">
data raising</span> can be applied. MedFisis supports the integration of such process to
<span style="font-weight:bold">Manage Logbook Data</span>.&nbsp; Another important feature is the ability to store non census information for cross checking fishing logs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial"><span style="font-weight:bold"><a name="artisanal">Artisanal fisheries</a></span>: Include all kind of fisheries to which information is collected with questionnaires, interviews or direct observations on the
 fishing vessels, at landing sites, processing plants, or in markets. Variables that enumerators can collect include catch (landing and discards), effort, vessel/gears, operations, biological variables (e.g. weight; length; sex, etc.), the values and quantities
 of landings and sales. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">Along with information on effort and catch, MedFisis support information taken from biological sampling, like sample dimension -
<span style="font-weight:bold">number of sampled individuals</span> - and the average weight per individual. Further developments will allow the storage of additional variables coming from biological sampling, such as length, ages and sex.
<br>
</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId955812">THE SAMPLING PROCESS</a></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">The collection of fisheries data is in most situations an expensive and hard task to execute. Mainly due to the nature of the fishing activity (spread along the countries coast, ...) , but also for the lack
 of accuracy of the information that sometimes is provided as well as for the difficulty it may represents for the fishermen, mainly artisanal, to answer and fill in such complex forms to deliver data. Sampling approach is more cost-effective approach then
 total enumeration process and if sampling design is well tailored to the fishery it will produce accurate results.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">On the other hand, the collection of 100% fishing reports, such as logbooks, is most of the times not reachable. If these data is not inspected a posteriori in order to overcome the possible problem of misrepresentation
 and inaccuracy it may lead to the production of biased and incomplete estimates.
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">MedFisis integrate the possibility to store and manage census data and sampling data, both for artisanal fisheries and logbook (industrial fisheries). Regarding sampling data,
<span style="font-weight:bold">Medfisis 1.1</span> can store, manage and perform statistical analysis for sampling surveys based on
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a name="random">random sampling</a></span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">
<a name="stratified_random">stratified random sampling</a></span>. <br>
Future developments of Medfisis will be able to store, manage and perform statistical analysis of sampling data collected based on more sophisticated methodologies , such as cluster sampling and multistage sampling.
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial">However in order to enable analysis of sampling data, a complete description of the sampling process must be provided. This includes: identification of sampling design and storage of the metadata associated
 - like size of population, size of sample a description of the sample units, if stratified sampling used, also a description of the strata and the population and sample distribution per strata.
<br>
</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0.35cm; font-family:Arial"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId424567">RATIONAL OF DATA HIERARCHY</a></h2>
<span style="font-family:Arial">The hierarchical organisation of Medfisis to store fisheries data, follows&nbsp; the logic of the description of a data collection process.
</span><span style="font-family:Arial">It starts by <br>
Figure shown below presents the hierarchy organisation of the levels for data storage in MedFisis application.</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. If data source logbooks, then the user will have to come through a process of description of the geographical
 and temporal scope - the sampling frame, then the description of the group of landing sites included in the process, and the identification of the vessels, fishing trips and so forth until the data on catch had been submitted. However, if data sourceis artisanal
 fisheries, two more levels&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It begins by the definition of the data collection process - defining the geographical and temporal scope - by creating the
<span style="font-weight:bold">sampling frame</span>. After the frame became initialised, the sampling process needs to be described. the Thus creating the minor strata which corresponds to Group of landings sites being this the first major level to be considered.
 From the minor strata two differentes approach may occur given the nature of data source in use. I<br>
Logbooks, user must define the vessels for which information has been collected for each minor strata created. Thus, for each vessel information on fishing trips, fishing operation and catch shall be entered.
<br>
For Artisanal fisheries, after the definition of the minor strata, user must identify levels taken below to characterise the sampling process. Thus, for each minor strata - Group of landing sites - the landing sites considered shall be identified, and for each
 of this landing site - cell - the type of vessels shall be characterised.With the characterisation of the vessels type, the follow level will be the same as for the logbooks, with the identification of each vessel and the fishing activity. (fishing trips/operations
 and catch). The hierarchy drives the user to give information that characterises the sampling process moving through out a process of
</span><span style="font-family:Arial">increasing </span><span style="font-family:Arial">details&nbsp; till the moment of the proper data entering. Catch and effort data.<br>
<br>
we consider two standard sampling processes: logbook and sampling. These two processes have some common stages in the beginning and in the end, and the sampling process adds a few more levels in the middle. This structure is more easily perceived looking at
 the database table flow, bellow.</span><span style="font-family:Arial">Thus, we have 4 stages on the
</span><em style="font-family:Arial">logbook</em><span style="font-family:Arial"> sampling (Minor Strata, Vessel, Trip and Operation) and 6 stages in the
